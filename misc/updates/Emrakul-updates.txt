A few updates for the **Emrakul** bot over the past year. Sometimes Emrakul is sassy or just doesn't feel like things, so please don't take it personally.

Fixes compared to the Bolas bot:
>> Regex works like on Scryfall
>> DFC cards now work for both the price command and by searching via [name] // [name]
>> If you search something incorrectly, Emrakul only embarrasses you for 5...4...3...2...1 [poof]
>> "sad robot", "bob" and "tim" now show the proper versions they reference

BIG UPDATE: Emrakul now works with threads!

New functions:
1. Get the current updates on Emrakul bot
Example: !updates
>> Returns this text file

2. Get tokens of a public decklist on archidekt
Example: !tokens https://archidekt.com/decks/1875179#[EDH/B] Adeline, ♡ GRL PWR ♡
>> This lists all tokens in your archidekt list. It shows even those that don't have a printed token, as it checks the text instead of just Scryfall data
>> It only works with archidekt, mostly because other webpages show tokens so have less need

3. Get tokens of the top [10] public decklists of a user on archidekt with [filter]
Example 1: !all_tokens https://archidekt.com/user/2874
Example 2: !all_tokens https://archidekt.com/user/2874 [EDH/B]
Example 3: !all_tokens https://archidekt.com/user/2874 5
>> This sends you a private message with the tokens in the top [10] public decklists of your user account
>> By providing a link to your user account, you get the tokens of the top 10 last edited public decklists
>> You can provide a filter for the titles of your decklist, like in the example above, I put [EDH/B] for all my built decklists, so I filter those. Also here, you will get a >> You can provide a number lower than 10 if you want less, but 10 will always be the maximum of 10 lists, due to performance issues (...it's 11 webcalls + checking through ~65-80 different cards per deck for tokens)

4. Get a random card image [by a Scryfall Query]
Example 1: !random
Example 2: !random is:commander
>> Returns a random card image within the query
>> If no query is provided, it returns a random card

5. Get a cute image
Example: !cute
>> Returns a cute card.
>> It used to search for art:cute, but for some reason people didn't think they're cute, so I changed it to art:tentacles.
>> That means it always returns an extra cute card

6. Check legality of a card
Example: !legality Black Lotus
>> Returns the legality in formats

7. Flirt with Emrakul
Example: !flirt
>> Emrakul notices you...from the moon

8. Roll a dice
Example 1: !roll
Example 2: !roll d69
>> Returns a random roll of the provided dice
>> If no dice is provided, it chooses a random dice from among d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20
>> Sometimes things go wrong :(

9. Flip a coin
Example: !flip
>> Returns heads or tails
>> It takes a 50/50 split on heads or tails as the starting position, then returns the coin flip 51/49 in favor of that side, to emulate a physical coin flip
>> Absolutely no reason why to implement this
>> Due to this being a complicated physics experiment, you have a 1:6000 chance for the coin to land on its side, as Emrakul is flipping a US nickel
>> I do assume earth gravity, even if Emrakul is somehow hidden in the moon of a plane
>> Do we even know if the gravity on Magic's planes are all the same, or is this our biased view from earth

10. Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar
Example: !asmor
>> Return Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar

11. Download a simple Chrome extension that restores the Magiccards.info function to auto-focus the search bar.
Example: !scryfall_extension
>> Returns install instructions + a zip file with the appropriate files
>> You can open those files and see what they do before installing, so you can be ensured I don't try to steal your personal info

12. Get color pie information
Example 1: !colorpie
Example 2: !colorpie w
Example 3: !colorpie u secondary
Example 4: !colorpie black 1
Example 5: !colorpie red tertiary
>> Searches the latest color pie article, then returns the text as markdown in a message if it's short enough, and as a text file if not
>> As you can see from above, you can shorten colors by their mana symbol (u = blue), and primary etc. as a number (secondary = 2)
>> Any other queries will result in Emrakul asking you to provide any of the above possibilities
>> Future updates will allow you to query and get definitions, but with different functions

13. Get the color pie link
Example: !colorpie_link
>> Returns the current color pie article links by searching for them on the Magic Articles website

14. Ask Emmy for advice
Example: !advice [any text]
>> Returns an Magic 8 Ball answer.
>> Sometimes it returns just general advice.
>> Sometimes it thinks you're valid.

15. Calculate the power level of your deck
Example: !powerlevel
>> Returns 7.

16. Ask Emmy for a cut in your deck
Example: !cut
>> Returns a typical card you would cut.

Other updates:
1. !rule has been upgraded in two ways:
>> When calling the function, the bot checks if Wizards has added a new ruling document to their ruling page
>> If yes, it replaces the current document
>> Then it returns the ruling, and includes a link to the rule on Yawgatog (Hyperlinked Magic Comprehensive Rules)
>> When a ruling is longer than the max amount of text that Discord allows, it cuts it off accordingly, which fixes !rule 205.3m

2. When searching a card name via brackets [[Gishath]], I check first if a card that is a commander would be returned, and the name includes the exact text you provide.
>> I noticed a lot of people search for a commander with the name, which often returns an entire list of cards
>> This basically fixes this for useability, without disturbing too many searches, as it does not change searches that uses Scryfall syntax

3. Added the functionalities that the Scryfall bot provides when searching:
>> Basically you can now user either !price Gishath or [[$Gishath]]
>> !price Gishath == [[$Gishath]]
>> !rulings Gishath == [[?Gishath]]
>> !legality Gishath == [[#Gishath]]

4. The list of nicknames has been extended:
>> Magus of the Cradle: Circle of Dreams Druid
>> TWD: Walking Dead
>> Streve: Strefan, Maurer Progenitor
>> Ayaya: Ayara, First of Locthwain

5. Due to high demand, you can [[Pot of Greed]]
>> A lot of people are confused by this elusive card, so I provide help with this
>> Returns the card text of Pot of Greed
